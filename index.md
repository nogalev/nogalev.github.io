I am a materials chemist focused on electrochemistry, organic electronics, and thin-film devices.

- MSc in Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science
- Advisors: Prof. Milko van der Boom - Dr. Michal Lahav
- Thesis: *Tailoring the Electrochromic Properties of Thin Films with a Nanoscale Metal-Organic Insulating Interlayer*
- Interests: electrochromic coatings and devices, photo-electrochromic hybrids, DSSCs, graphene integration, low-temperature Cu(111) single-crystal preparation, data-driven materials workflows

#### Highlights
- Designed and tested electrochromic metal-organic thin films for tunable optical response
- Built device workflows for electrochromic and photo-electrochromic stacks
- Hands-on with Raman, UV-Vis, UPS, SEM-EDS, basic ALD and PECVD interfaces, glovebox workflows
- Secondary role in IT at 2D Generation - lab compute, data organization, and simple automations

#### Current goals
- Transition lab methods into robust, reproducible device protocols
- Push low-temperature pathways toward single-crystal Cu(111) for catalysis and 2D materials
- Publish and package analysis tools for spectroscopy data

title: Electrochromic thin films with nanoscale metal-organic interlayers
date: 2024-11-01
---

**Goal:** Tailor optical contrast and switching stability via interfacial control.

**What I did**
- Designed interlayers to modulate ion transport and charge storage
- Built repeatable voltage protocols and lifetime testing
- Produced figures for spectra - coloration efficiency - cycling

**Stack**
- Raman - UV-Vis - UPS - SEM-EDS
- Python notebooks for spectral analysis

**Status:** Thesis complete - manuscript preparation
